# GO++ 

## Overview

GO++ is a C++ library that brings Golang-style concurrency features to C++. It offers a suite of concurrency primitives such as channels, thread pools, and wait groups, designed to simplify the development of concurrent applications in C++.

## Features

- **Channels**: Facilitates communication between threads with finite and list-based channels.
- **Thread Pools**: Manages a pool of threads to execute tasks concurrently, with finite and list-based options.
- **Wait Groups**: Synchronizes the completion of a collection of threads.
- **Select**: Provides a multiplexer for channel operations, inspired by Golang's `select` statement.
